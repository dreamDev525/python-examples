# Brick's Python Examples: 2021
### Current Example Scripts:

## 1. crypto/PriceStream.py    
    -> Creates/subscribes to binance websocket to retrieve live price data. 
    -> This is done using standard python libraries, not python api wrappers.
    
## 2. data/Binary.py
    -> Compresses multi-dimensional arrays into 1D array, saves to binary file. 
    -> Unpacks binary file into usable python dict
    -> This is useful for storing large data-sets without taking up much hard-drive space.
